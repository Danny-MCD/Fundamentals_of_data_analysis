Module:     Fundamentals of Data Analysis

Project:    Analysis of Iris data set using Python programming

---

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to source a data set, for this project I will be utilising the Iris Flower Data set. Python will be used to programmatically explore and visualise the data.
Basic mathematical data analysis will be performed on the data set to get a better understanding of it and the variables that it is composed off. Python programmes will be written to automate this basic analysis

## Analysis
Each of the variables contained in the Iris flower data set will be discussed and classified according to common variable types as found in mathematics, statistics and python. These variables will then be summarised into statistics for comparison to each other and for visualisation. The most appropriate plots to visualise this data will then be added into the jupyter notebook to demonstrate visually how the variables appear when grouped together. 

## Installation
This project is written in Python and uses Jupyter Notebooks to display it. It can be run using a python interpreter but for best presentation of it. It should be opened with Juypter Notebooks.
