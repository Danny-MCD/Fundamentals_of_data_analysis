# 1.3 What is most approriate probability distribtuion as selected from the numpy random distribution list for each of the variables in the penguins data set.

There are two types of variables that all variables in the penguins data set fit into Categorical and Numeric. For a categorical variable such as those for species or island of origin, with a distinct choice the *numpy.random.choice* distirbution is the most appropriate proabaility distribution to use. The other type of variable found in the penguins data set is a continous variable for the variables of the measurements of the penguins bill, flipper and body mass. Presuming these measurements follow a normal distribution around a central mean then a *numpy.random.normal* distribution is the most appropriate probablity distribution to use.
